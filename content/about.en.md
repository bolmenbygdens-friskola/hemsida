Here we answer frequently asked questions. You can also contact one of us - we will be happy to help you.

## How do I apply for pre-school, school and after-school care?
The application is not yet open, but you can register your interest via the link here. You will then be informed when the application opens!

## Do you follow the Education Act, other laws and regulations and the national curricula?
Yes, all schools in Sweden are obliged to follow these. There is no difference between municipal and independent schools. The Swedish Schools Inspectorate and Ljungby municipality monitor our activities both through inspections and through surveys of pupils, guardians and staff. 
## How large groups will you work with?
We think it is important to work with groups and classes that are small in order for it to be calm and for each child to learn as much as possible. This is also supported by research.

## Will you offer school transportation?
Yes, Bolmenbygdens Friskola will arrange school transportation for all students. We also intend to enable trips from both Ljungby and Lagan.
We offer a school transport concept that makes everyday life easier for both children and parents. We pick up the pupils directly from their homes in the morning. Our school buses are driven by reliable adults with good local knowledge, which ensures a personal and safe journey every day. In the afternoon, the children are dropped off back at their homes, so that the day ends in a calm and safe manner.

## Is membership or work effort required?
No, neither.

We will offer a voluntary membership. The association will have a general meeting once a year where you can participate and elect the board and get information about the business.

## Do you make a profit?
No, we are an economic association and do not intend to make a profit. Our children deserve that we put all our money into making it good for them. However, we will try to save money some years to be able to even out between years and to be able to invest extra in other years, for example in support, teaching materials or premises.
