# Welcome to Bolmenbygdens Friskola!

Bolmenbygdens Friskola is a new elementary school that offers a safe space for curiosity and nature-based learning. We welcome students in grades F–6 and also provide after-school care and school transport for all students.

With us, children grow in a calm and inspiring environment – with small class sizes, close relationships between students and adults, and a curriculum where water, storytelling, and nature are part of every day.

The school is scheduled to open in the autumn term of 2027. To stay up to date on the process, register your interest via the link above!  
*(Registration is not an application to the school; that will come at a later stage.)*

# What makes us unique?
- **Learning in natural environments**    
    Regular excursions and outdoor learning – by the lake, in the forest, and in the meadows.

- **Focus on water & sustainability**    
We work across subjects with water, environment, and ecology as common themes.

- **Storytelling in education**    
Children express themselves through oral, written, and digital storytelling – often inspired by Lake Bolmen.

- **Good food – every day**    
We prioritize tasty, nutritious, and locally produced meals.

- **Safety and closeness**    
A small school where everyone is seen and every child is supported to grow.

- **Safe school transport – directly from home**
We believe in a close relationship between school and home, and that starts with the first journey of the morning.
