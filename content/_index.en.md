# Welcome to Bolmenbygdens Friskola!

Bolmenbygdens Friskola is a new elementary school that offers a safe space for curiosity and nature-based learning. We welcome students in grades F–6 and also provide after-school care and school transport for all students.

With us, children grow in a calm and inspiring environment – with small class sizes, close relationships between students and adults, and a curriculum where water, storytelling, and nature are part of every day.

The school is planned to start in the fall semester of 2027 - Welcome with your expression of interest!  
*(registration of interest is not binding)*

# What makes us unique?
- **Learning in natural environments**    
    Regular excursions and outdoor learning – by the lake, in the forest, and in the meadows.

- **Focus on water & sustainability**    
We work across subjects with water, environment, and ecology as common themes.

- **Storytelling in education**    
Children express themselves through oral, written, and digital storytelling – often inspired by Lake Bolmen.

- **Good food – every day**    
We prioritize tasty, nutritious, and locally produced meals.

- **Safety and closeness**    
A small school where everyone is seen and every child is supported to grow.
