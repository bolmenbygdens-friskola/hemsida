## Business concept for Bolmenbygdens friskola 
**– with a focus on water, storytelling, and learning in a natural environment**   
  
Bolmenbygdens friskola is a safe, engaging, and close-knit school that offers an education where nature, storytelling, and the water in Lake Bolmen play a central role. Our ambition is for every student to grow in knowledge, curiosity, and responsibility in a stimulating environment where theory and practice meet in real-life contexts.
We welcome students from preschool to grade 6 and create a school where each individual is seen and supported in their development together with dedicated teachers, in close collaboration with their homes and the local community.

### A clear profile for meaningful learning
**Water as a learning environment and area of knowledge**  
  
By working in an interdisciplinary way with water as a starting point, students gain a deeper understanding of its ecological, historical, and social significance. Through field studies, practical projects, and collaboration with local actors, we create a unique opportunity to put knowledge into action and contribute to sustainable development.  
  
**Storytelling as an educational tool**   
Storytelling strengthens language, creativity, and identity. Students get to express themselves orally, in writing, and artistically, drawing inspiration from the local storytelling culture. This promotes both personal development and interdisciplinary learning.   
  
**The natural environment as a living classroom**   
Nature is an active part of our teaching – here, students are given the opportunity to learn through movement, experiences, and practical experiments. We use the changing seasons and local natural resources to create context and connections to sustainability, health, and community. 


### Our mission and goals
We offer every student:
- A safe and stimulating school environment with excellent opportunities to acquire and develop knowledge and values in accordance with school legislation and the curriculum.
- A holistic approach to learning where water, storytelling, and the natural environment create relevance and engagement. 
- Opportunities for exploration and practical work with real-world connections. 
- Support in developing their communication skills and creativity. 
- A foundation for an active outdoor life and sustainable lifestyle. 
- Security and self-confidence that prepare students for further education and life's challenges. 

### The values that guide our work   
**Security** – We build the school on a stable foundation where every student feels seen, respected, and secure enough to develop.   
**Together** – The school is a community where students, staff, guardians, and the local community work together to create the best learning environment.   
**Close** – With smaller groups and local collaborations, we are responsive to the needs and interests of our students and can adapt our activities accordingly.   


We want to be an independent school that complements and strengthens the municipal school system by offering a unique profile and strong local roots. Through close collaboration with the municipality and other stakeholders, we contribute to the best interests of our students and a vibrant community.
